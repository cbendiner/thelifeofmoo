<h2>This is My Family</h2>
<div class="familytext">
<p>My human family consists of mom, dad, China, Colin, and Cassie- who are my human siblings. We lived in Pinehurst, North Carolina for 5 years before we moved to New Buffalo, Michigan. It was really warm in the South and there were a lot of squirrels. We would have lots of movie nights together in the living room. When I was a puppy I escaped from the fenced yard and was gone for 3 days. My family missed me so much that I decided to come back- covered in sewer water! As you can see, we've been through it all. There's nothing I love more than my family and nothing they love more than me! </p>

<h4>Mom</h4>

This is my human mom, Peggy! She likes to listen to Def Leppard and doesn't give me extra treats. But that's okay because she makes my homemade food for me. It's white rice, chicken stock, vegetables, and ground turkey. She even gives me more wet food on top!
<h4>Dad</h4>
<center><img class="img" src="dad1.jpg" alt="Dad" width="150" height="100"></center>
This is my human dad, Matt! He likes all things Superman and gives me extra treats. Since my human parents are divorced, he takes me on weekly walks! I miss him A LOT. He always rubs my belly and gives me extra treats, did I say that already?
<h4>China</h4>
<center><img class="img" src="china1.jpg" alt="China" width="160" height="125"></center>
This is my human sister, China! She gives me extra treats all the time and she is my favorite human. We do everything together. She takes me on daily walks, saves me from stupid owners who let their dogs run unleashed and try to play with me before realizing I have slight anger issues :( She gives me baths and rubs my belly. 
<h4>Colin</h4>
<center><img class="img" src="colin1.jpg" alt="Colin" width="170" height="125"></center>
This is my human brother, Colin! He's a little loud and annoying like brothers are but I still love him. He generally gives me extra treats, which is important. He likes spiderman and not cleaning his room. 
<h4>Cassie</h4>
<center><img class="img" src="cassie1.jpg" alt="Cassie" width="167" height="125"></center>
This is my human sister, Cassie! She lives far away in Oregon with two human puppies of her own, so I never see her these days. But I love her. She enjoys all things Disney and obsessively cleaning.
